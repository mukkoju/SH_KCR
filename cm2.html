                    At the behest of Telangana State, a meeting was conducted today by the Secretary, Ministry of Transport and Highways of Government of India, in New Delhi. Chief Secretary of Telangana, Shri Rajiv Sharma and Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh, Shri. I V R Krishna Rao attended the meeting.

                <p>
                    Telangana Chief Secretary stated that the distribution of assets of APSRTC must be done based on territorial principle which is mentioned clearly in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act. Since Andhra Pradesh Government gave the view that the assets in Hyderabad should be divided, Telangana Chief Secretary insisted that pending a decision on the disputed issues, the State Road Transport Corporation should be divided without delay and the division of staff should also be finalized quickly without referring to Kamalnathan Committee as the mandate of this committee is limited to State Government staff only.
                <p>
                    It was insisted by the Chief Secretary of Telangana, that, division of RTC should be done quickly for the growth and stability of RTC in both the states because in the absence of a proper board the decisions on policy issues and investment are kept pending.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Government of India promised to expedite the process for division of RTC, pending the resolution of contentious issues.
